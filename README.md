# Quadrucopter

This repository contains two directories: one with C-code communication of the computer 
with an xbee module via an emulated com port by a FT232 connected to the usb port. 
The other directory contains AVR-C code running on the quadrucopters hardware (ATMEGA64 and ATMEGA8) 
and Eagle files for the electronic layout of different components.
